text: The practice of law can be expensive, if you would like to ensure that
  Advocates for Animals can help out as many groups as possible at an affordable
  rate we would appreciate your support. In addition to helping animal
  protection organisations through use of the law, Advocates for Animals would
  like the freedom to bring cases on behalf of itself that we feel are essential
  to help animals. If you would like to ensure that we can bring these cases,
  please donate. Thank you.

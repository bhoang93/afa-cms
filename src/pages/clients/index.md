      on many aspects of animal law and see projects through to successful
      completion.
    author: "- Cruelty Free International"
  - quote: Edie Bowles and David Thomas have given advice to our charity at short
      notice to a high standard. Their knowledge has helped us campaign
      effectively and ensured that we use the law to help animals in need
      wherever possible. We highly recommend Advocates for Animals.
    author: "- Freedom for Animals"
  - quote: It’s been my privilege to have worked closely with David and Edie for
      many years, so I know first-hand the quality of their work.  Their
      knowledge in the field is unparalleled and their passion and commitment
      unwavering. Advocates for Animals has my full support in their important
      work of using the law to make a real and long-lasting difference for
      animals.
    author: "- Animal Free Research"
  - quote: Thorough, clear, considered and professional in your approach to us as
      your clients, you advised us fully together with counsel, as to the merits
      and non merits of each option available to us on complex areas of law,
      this enabled us to undertake an informed campaign strategy both in the
      long and short term. As a group reliant on self generated funding we found
      your costs both reasonable and achievable. Our sincere thanks and we would
      have no hesitation in recommending you or your practice to others who
      share a sincere interest in pursuing lawful means by which to challenge
      the plight of those who cannot challenge for themselves. We look forward
      to working with you again in the future as we felt you understood the
      value of respect both to your clients and to those they seek to protect in
      our case, the thousands of greyhounds used within the racing industry here
      in the UK.
    author: "- Greyt Exploitations"
  - quote: The IVRA has recently worked with Edie on a variety of matters and has
      found her work to be extremely useful. The network is very much in need of
      Edie’s dedicated service which is invaluable to support and further the
      aims and objectives of the organisation.
    author: "- The International Vegans Rights Alliance"
  - quote: I have known David for over 20 years and would have no hesitation in
      instructing his firm to act for us. David is a deeply committed, highly
      capable legal professional with a dogged determination to do the very best
      for animals and the people and organisations who advocate for them.
    author: "- Compassion in World Farming"
  - quote: David has provided excellent quality legal advice to Animal Aid. It is so
      reassuring to work with someone who has such brilliant legal expertise,
      but also understands the specific issues relating to animal protection,
      and shares our dedication to making the world a better place for animals.
      As well as being extremely helpful, David’s advice has always been
      presented to us in a clear, non-technical way, which makes the process of
      dealing with legal issues so much easier. I would have full confidence in
      recommending David to any animal protection organisation who was looking
      for legal advice.
    author: "- Animal Aid"
  - quote: The services set out by Advocates for Animals are absolutely invaluable
      to animal protection NGOs aiming to take the most direct route to creating
      sustained change for animals, to maximise impact, and to minimise risk. At
      Humane Society International I fully anticipate we would instruct the
      firm, particularly with regard to the complex legal landscape around trade
      as the U.K. departs the EU, an area in which David is extremely well
      versed. Having sought and used advice from the solicitors behind this firm
      before I can attest not only to their in-depth knowledge of the law as it
      relates to animal protection, but also to their understanding and
      accommodation of the varying strategies, positions and messaging held by
      their clients. This new law firm is a logical and much-needed step to
      increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the animal protection
      movement in the U.K.
    author: "- Humane Society International"
  - quote: Advocates for Animals provide a unique blend of legal expertise and
      passion for campaigning to make the world a better place for animals. This
      means they don’t discourage clients from taking risks if the benefits to
      animals could be great, but rather advise on ways to mitigate risks or
      even suggest better ideas based on their long history of work in this
      sector. They are always professional, responsive and committed to
      achieving the best possible outcome for animals while also protecting the
      charities and activists they represent. I can’t recommend them highly
      enough.
    author: "- Animal Equality"
  - quote: Alice Collinson brings an in-depth understanding and highly professional
      approach to her analyses of wildlife law and international legal process.
      She is also able to fulfil complex requests in a timely, coherent and
      cost-effective manner, and her reporting is outstanding. She is our first
      port-of-call when it comes to making sense of international wildlife
      legislation.
    author: "- Born Free"
  - quote: Save The Asian Elephants fights hard every day for the protection and
      preservation of the critically endangered Asian elephant, so grievously
      abused in unethical tourism and other exploitative practices. Of necessity
      we engage in complex issues which often call for a clear focus and
      understanding of the law and legal procedures. David Thomas and Edie
      Bowles and their team at Advocates for Animals have provided STAE with
      specialist and timely advice of a high standard on several occasions. We
      are very pleased to be working with them.
    author: "- Save The Asian Elephants"
  - quote: Edie and the team at Advocates for Animals went above and beyond to help
      us save over 80 pigs from a court destruction order. They overturned this
      order with their legal expertise. They are an amazing team of legal
      experts, professional, supportive and 100% dedicated.
    author: "- Beneath The Wood Sanctuary"
  - quote: Advocates for Animals are professional and thorough, enabling us to
      mitigate risks and ensure we can run effective campaigns. They’ve given us
      legal advice at little notice that has been crucial for us to be nimble
      and respond to changing events when they unfold. Their work is outstanding
      and always turned around in a timely manner. We highly recommend Edie and
      David for anyone in the animal protection movement that wants reliable,
      easy to understand details on any work they need to assess for legal
      issues.
    author: "- The Humane League UK"
  - quote: The Donkey Sanctuary has drawn on the legal expertise of Advocates for
      Animals for over two years now. It would be hard to overstate the amazing
      support they have provided to us in respect of some of our key campaigns –
      from poring over our campaign literature from a legal perspective, to
      liaising with regional legislative bodies overseas, briefing and
      instructing lawyers in overseas countries on our behalf and generally
      making the complexities of legal possibilities and consequences
      comprehensible and also affordable. They are now an integral part of our
      campaign planning and thinking. They are approachable, engaged and
      passionate about the issues. We know that we will always get expert advice
      and insight from them, and they will always pull out all the stops if that
      is needed quickly.More than anything, they care about what we are doing
      and share our objectives and determination to secure improvements for
      animal welfare through legal processes and mechanisms. We can’t recommend
      them highly enough.
    author: "- The Donkey Sanctuary"
  - quote: >
      Advocates for Animals with their invaluable knowledge in the fight for all
      animals are a huge step forward for animals having a voice, a voice that
      will end cruelty and bring an understanding of what is right and what is
      wrong. Their passion and indomitable spirit along with their expertise in
      animal welfare and rights takes them that extra mile. Without Advocates
      for Animals acting for me there would be no tears of happiness, there
      would be no peace in the hearts of this lady and her dog.
    author: "- Mrs Lane"
  - quote: >-
      Animal welfare law is a specialist and growing area of concern and can and
      should be used to affect positive change for animals. The scope for making
      improvements for animal welfare both here in the UK and abroad is immense.
      Our experience of the ban on fur farming here in the UK as well as EU-wide
      import bans on cat and dog fur and the products of commercial seal hunts
      have shown just what can be achieved and the huge impacts these
      initiatives can have.


      The experience and dedication of the team at Advocates for Animals as well as a proven record of achievement in animal law means they are uniquely qualified and we very much look forward to future collaborations


      Advocates For Animals is long overdue and Respect for Animals would have no hesitation in instructing this firm in the future.
    author: Respect for Animals
  - quote: Animal Justice Project has worked with Edie and David at Advocates for
      Animals on our most high-profile campaign to date. In some tough times,
      they have protected our organisation and enabled us to tackle animal
      industries head on. Their legal skills are superb, providing important
      advice on how to mitigate risk, which is particularly important for our
      pressure campaigns. Their unwavering passion for animals makes them
      perfect partners for us. Animal Justice Project is so grateful to
      Advocates for all the work they have carried out with us so far, and would
      have absolutely no hesitation in recommending them to other animal NGOs.

      # David Thomas


      David is a solicitor and part-time judge. He has acted for nearly all the major animal protection organisations in the UK (and beyond) and is highly experienced in EU and international animal law, including trade law. He has also acted extensively in human rights cases (which can be relevant to animal protection law), much of it again international, and public law more generally.He is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, a former chair of the RSPCA (currently a trustee) and a former director of Cruelty Free International and Compassion in World Farming. He has written extensively about animal protection law and ethics and taken part in numerous presentations, debates and media appearances. He gave oral evidence to the Burns Inquiry on hunting and has given oral testimony to several parliamentary committees and a Royal Commission as well as holding countless meetings with ministers and officials. He has been a member of European Commission and UK government panels and is an experienced teacher of law.


      ### How did you get into animal protection?


      I have had an interest since a young age. I ran RSPCA Cardiff Dog's Home as an 18 year old volunteer before going to uni. I have always believed that one assesses injustice by its effect on the victim, not on the victim's identity, Sadly humankind's inhumanity to humankind, terrible though it is, is dwarfed by humanity's inhumanity to other animals. Society should fight injustice wherever it finds it and I have also done a lot of human rights legal work.


      ### Why do you care about animal law?


      I believe that the law - working in close harmony with science, investigative skills, ethical argument, campaigning and lobbying - can make a huge difference to the welfare of animals, through creative deployment at each stage of the campaigning process. Ultimately, though education has a vital role, the best protection is through well-drawn, philosophically consistent, properly interpreted and rigorously enforced legislation.

      # Edie Bowles


      Edie is a solicitor specialising in animal protection law. She has advised many animal protection organisations and individuals on a wide range of issues, including all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act and regulations made under it, the Zoo Licensing Act, Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act and more. She is a trustee of The Humane League and the UK Centre for Animal Law, where she set up and managed the student group. She often speaks on animal protection issues and has done so in the UK Parliament, the French Senat and the East African Legislative Assembly.


      ### How did you get into animal protection?


      For as long I can remember I have felt empathy towards animals and recognised their vulnerability at the hands of human interest, whether commercial or simply sadistic. This awareness has led to me carving a career aimed at ensuring animals are given the protections they are entitled to under the law.


      ### Why do you care about animal law?


      Despite all the incredible attributes animals possess and their sentience, they are extremely vulnerable in our society, it is therefore essential that a framework is in place to prevent certain treatment. You do not have to be an animal lover or an activist in this area to recognise that animals deserve protection under the law and that those laws need to be enforced.

      # Vanessa Johansson


      Vanessa has dedicated her career to the non-profit and education sectors. From management to hands-on help, Vanessa loves guiding people and organisations towards success. In 2018, she co-founded the Solberga Foundation, a philanthropic organisation focused on animal and environmental justice. Enthusiastic and personable, she is a tireless advocate for a more compassionate world. Vanessa joins the team as an Operational Support Officer.


      ### How did you get into animal protection?


      My mission in life is to seek justice for animals and reduce as much suffering as possible. My passion for this cause has led me to volunteer for a number of animal charities and establish an organisation that supports the animal protection industry. As a dedicated vegan, I also try to be an ambassador for animal protection wherever I can. When I learned of Advocates for Animals’ mission: ‘making full use of the law to protect animals’ I was eager to get involved.


      ### Why do you care about animal law?


      Without a voice to speak up and protest their treatment, animals are among the most abused beings on the planet. If we ensure existing laws and regulations are strictly enforced, we can significantly improve animal protection.

      Alice is a solicitor with a particular interest in international wildlife protection law.She has worked as a legal consultant with many leading animal welfare and conservation organisations in the UK and abroad, following an international Animal Law masters (LL.M) from Lewis and Clark Law School in the U.S, and 6 years as a civil litigation lawyer in London.She provides legal training on captive animal legislation as a trustee with Freedom for Animals, supports the UK Centre for Animal Law student team, and sits on the British Veterinary Association’s Ethics and Welfare Advisory Panel.


      ### How did you get into animal protection?


      A passion for wildlife has drawn me to a number volunteer projects from a young age; to include tracking endangered wild dogs in South Africa, caring for elephants released from the tourist industry in Thailand, and rehabilitating rescued seals in Cornwall. Pursuing the Animal Law masters has enabled me to focus my legal skills entirely on animal protection.


      ### Why do you care about animal law?


      Animals are primarily property in the eyes of the law, with minimal protections across the many industries that impact billions of individual sentient beings. At the very least, we should effectively enforce existing laws to protect animals internationally, and challenge the status quo to create change and reduce animal suffering.

![bear](https://advocates-for-animals-cms.netlify.app/admin/static/animal1-bef6a1e509dc5a250c5c696f2a81dc3e.jpg) **Advocates for Animals** is the first UK law firm dedicated to animal protection. It is a not for profit set up by **David Thomas** and **Edie Bowles**, two solicitors with vast combined experience in animal protection law. Before 1822 in this country – as in many countries around the world still – there was no law to protect animals. A man could beat his horse to death simply because it was his.The supervening two centuries have seen a large swathe of animal protection legislation, some of it very good. But there is indisputably **far more cruelty** caused to animals by human beings today than two hundred years ago.Attitudes are generally more enlightened, and there is less domestic cruelty, but technological developments mean that we can do things to animals today that we could not hitherto – in factory farms (where literally billions languish), in laboratories and so forth, far from public gaze. Millions of animals are transported as cargo across the world for various purposes.It is therefore essential that animal protection NGOs make maximum use of the tools at their disposal, as environmental groups and many social justice organisations already do very effectively. **Advocates for Animals** is committed to the creative use of the law – alongside investigations, science, lobbying, social and traditional media – to make a huge difference to the lives of animals.Advocates for Animals will not act against an animal group or an animal activist unless the matter involves an animal protection issue.

      <p className="expertise__text">
        Judicial review is a type of legal action under which decisions of
        ministers and other public officials can be challenged. It is the means
        by which the judiciary ensures that public bodies keep within the law.
        As such, it is a vital tool in a democracy and there have been many
        famous cases, including recently the successful challenge to the
        Government’s attempt to circumvent Parliament over the Brexit Article 50
        process. ‘Decision’ is interpreted broadly, such that (for example) a
        failure to make a decision can be challenged, as can secondary
        legislation falling outside the ambit of an Act of Parliament.
      </p>

      <p className="expertise__text">
        Note that judicial review can only be used where there is said to be an
        error of law. You cannot normally challenge a finding of fact or the way
        a public body has exercised a discretion or judgement entrusted to it by
        Parliament. However, you can do so if the finding of fact etc is
        unsupported by evidence or the public body has failed to take into
        account a material consideration (or taken into account an immaterial
        consideration). Procedural irregularity can also be challenged, such as
        a failure to consult properly or give adequate reasons.

      <p className="expertise__text">
        Animal protection organisations with expertise in a relevant area will
        usually be accorded standing to bring a case and they may also be
        allowed to intervene in a case brought by someone else. In these ways,
        the animals’ voice can be heard. There are strict time limits for
        bringing a case.

        Legal costs can be an issue. However, in a public interest case it is
        often possible to get a protective costs order, which limits exposure to
        costs if a case is ultimately unsuccessful.
      </p>

      <p className="expertise__text">
        Often with judicial review, a successful outcome can be achieved without
        needing to take a case to a full hearing. Public bodies will frequently
        concede a point of principle if a case is well-articulated, especially
        if a judge grants permission for a case to proceed (the first stage in
        the process). Indeed, they may do so after a pre-action letter. Because
        public bodies have a duty to be candid, the letter before action can be
        an useful way of obtaining documents.

        There is a similar process available to challenge planning decisions

      <p className="expertise__text">
        Other countries have similar mechanisms for challenging administrative
        decisions, some modelled on English judicial review.

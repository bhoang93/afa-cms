          David is a solicitor and part-time judge. He has acted for nearly all
          the major animal protection organisations in the UK (and beyond) and
          is highly experienced in EU and international animal law, including
          trade law. He has also acted extensively in human rights cases (which
          can be relevant to animal protection law), much of it again
          international, and public law more generally.

          How did you get into animal protection?
        </h3>
        <span className="profile__text--block">
          I have had an interest since a young age. I ran RSPCA Cardiff Dog's
          Home as an 18 year old volunteer before going to uni. I have always
          believed that one assesses injustice by its effect on the victim, not
          on the victim's identity, Sadly humankind's inhumanity to humankind,
          terrible though it is, is dwarfed by humanity's inhumanity to other
          animals. Society should fight injustice wherever it finds it and I
          have also done a lot of human rights legal work.

        <span className="profile__text--block">
          I believe that the law - working in close harmony with science,
          investigative skills, ethical argument, campaigning and lobbying - can
          make a huge difference to the welfare of animals, through creative
          deployment at each stage of the campaigning process. Ultimately,
          though education has a vital role, the best protection is through
          well-drawn, philosophically consistent, properly interpreted and
          rigorously enforced legislation.

          For as long I can remember I have felt empathy towards animals and
          recognised their vulnerability at the hands of human interest, whether
          commercial or simply sadistic. This awareness has led to me carving a
          career aimed at ensuring animals are given the protections they are
          entitled to under the law.

          Despite all the incredible attributes animals possess and their
          sentience, they are extremely vulnerable in our society, it is
          therefore essential that a framework is in place to prevent certain
          treatment. You do not have to be an animal lover or an activist in
          this area to recognise that animals deserve protection under the law
          and that those laws need to be enforced.

                  <strong>Advocates for Animals</strong> is the first UK law

                <span className="aboutus__content--block">
                  Before 1822 in this country – as in many countries around the
                  world still – there was no law to protect animals. A man could
                  beat his horse to death simply because it was his.
                </span>
                <span className="aboutus__content--block">
                  The supervening two centuries have seen a large swathe of
                  animal protection legislation, some of it very good. But there
                  is indisputably <strong>far more cruelty</strong> caused to
                  animals by human beings today than two hundred years ago.
                </span>
                <span className="aboutus__content--block">
                  Attitudes are generally more enlightened, and there is less
                  domestic cruelty, but technological developments mean that we
                  can do things to animals today that we could not hitherto – in
                  factory farms (where literally billions languish), in
                  laboratories and so forth, far from public gaze. Millions of
                  animals are transported as cargo across the world for various
                  purposes.

                <span className="aboutus__content--block">
                  It is therefore essential that animal protection NGOs make
                  maximum use of the tools at their disposal, as environmental
                  groups and many social justice organisations already do very
                  effectively. <strong>Advocates for Animals</strong> is
                  committed to the creative use of the law – alongside
                  investigations, science, lobbying, social and traditional
                  media – to make a huge difference to the lives of animals.

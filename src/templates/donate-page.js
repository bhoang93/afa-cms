          The practice of law can be expensive, if you would like to ensure that
          Advocates for Animals can help out as many groups as possible at an
          affordable rate we would appreciate your support. In addition to
          helping animal protection organisations through use of the law,
          Advocates for Animals would like the freedom to bring cases on behalf
          of itself that we feel are essential to help animals. If you would
          like to ensure that we can bring these cases, please donate. Thank
          you.
